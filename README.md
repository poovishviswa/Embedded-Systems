of registering the presence of students in the class. This system eliminates the need of manual
attendance which is a crucial task and also avoids the activities like proxy. The System also
ensures accuracy and efficiency in registering the student’s attendance without any
discrepancies. The system helps the faculty to track the regularity of the students attending the
class and help them to maintain their attendance percentage. It reduces the burden of the faculty
by simplifying the task of updating the student’s attendance in the portal without any
inconsistency. It records the identity of the students who are present and sends the
names/numbers to the teacher’s mobile number/ is sent via Bluetooth terminal. The pre-requisite
of the system is the photo copies of each and every student in the class. This reduces error
percentage of error occurring during the transmission of data.
